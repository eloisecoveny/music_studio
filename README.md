# Music Studio
**Group Project: Robert, Eloise, James**

Our brief is to build a full-stack application using JavaScript React framework in the front-end and Java Spring Boot Hibernate with a PostgreSQL database in the back-end.

We want to build an app that allows users to explore their musical curiosity by experimenting with mixing different musical melodies. The app will be compatible on larger screened devices such as laptops and tablets.

## MVP
A user should be able to:
- Create a personal profile they can log into.
- Play musical notes on a virtual piano keyboard based on user input from their device keyboard/touch screen with real-time audio output.
- Turn the metronome on and be guided by a beat.

## Possible Extensions
A user can:
- Choose from a range of different piano sounds.
- Record and save sequences to the database.
- Compile and layer different sequences.
- Collaborate with multiple users on the same project.
- Record their own voice or sounds via their microphone.

## Advanced Extensions
A user can:
- Choose from a variety of different instruments.
- Export their music in MP3, WAV or FLAC format.
